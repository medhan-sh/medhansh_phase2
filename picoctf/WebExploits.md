## Solution:

- The challenge was a simple sql injection problem where we were given the filters used started the challenge with 
figuring things out found this
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' AND password=''
```

- For the first challenge there weren't a lot of filters so used `admin'--` to bypass the password.

- The second round banned `--` so used `admin';` to bypass the password and move forward with the next round

- The third challenge did not ban anything that i was already using so used the same thing `admin';` to move forward to the next round.

-This part was tricky the filter blocked the word `admin`
