# 1. Web Gauntlet 

> Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:62078/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:62078/filter.php


## Solution:

- The challenge was a simple sql injection problem where we were given the filters used started the challenge with 
figuring things out found this
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' AND password=''
```

- For the first challenge there weren't a lot of filters so used `admin'--` to bypass the password.

- The second round banned `--` so used `admin';` to bypass the password and move forward with the next round

- The third challenge did not ban anything that i was already using so used the same thing `admin';` to move forward to the next round.

-This part was tricky the filter blocked the word `admin`

- The part wanted me to use String concatenation which i reffrenced from a sql cheatsheet i found online employed that to trick it into giving me admin without using admin used `adm'||'in';` which added the strings and then bypasses the password.

- The fifth round did not ban anything that i was already using so used the same thing again to complete the challenge
  `adm'||'in';` 
- The flag was present in the filter page.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Basics of Sql injection 
- Comment Payload:- `--` makes the sql ignore everything written after trating it as a comment rather than code which helps in bypassing the password for example in this challenge `--` made 
```
WHERE username='[YOUR INPUT]' AND password='...'
```
to 
```
WHERE username='admin'--'
```
- Simmilarly `;` maks an end to reading for sql, it wont read anything after this which would help in bypassing the password
- String concatenation:
You can concatenate together multiple strings to make a single string.
## Notes:

- The String Concatenation part was tricky took me a lot of time to figure that out.

# 2. SST1

> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

## Solution:

- Started by chekcking for vulnerability for server side template injection by `{{7*7}}` that did give an output so started using payloads i got from youtube tutorials the link to which is in refference `{{''.__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[141].__init__.__globals__['sys'].modules['os'].popen('id').read()}}`

<img width="1280" height="832" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-26 at 5 58 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d9ef298-3666-4ef9-b67b-cec67edc7678" />

<img width="1280" height="832" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-26 at 5 58 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/462156f8-ab37-4561-ab77-33dee2c2928d" />

- This did not work so used another payload which i got from a git repo called Payloadallthethings 
`{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read() }}`
<img width="1280" height="832" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-26 at 6 08 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f9bb55a-ce30-4b85-8fc1-8dbbef682235" />
- This worked so started looking for the flag used `ls` to list all the files then cat the flag file to obtain the flag.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_dcdca99a}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Server side template injection is a vulnerabilty where web engines use templates to embed dynamic content. Template Injection occurs when user input is embedded in a template in an unsafe manner.
- I dont really understand the entirity of the payload but it gave us acces to the OS without using `import os` we tricked it and then used commands once inside to obtain the flag.
  

## Notes:

- NONE
