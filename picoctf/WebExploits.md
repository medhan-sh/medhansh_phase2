# 1. Web Gauntlet 

> Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:62078/ http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:62078/filter.php


## Solution:

- The challenge was a simple sql injection problem where we were given the filters used started the challenge with 
figuring things out found this
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' AND password=''
```

- For the first challenge there weren't a lot of filters so used `admin'--` to bypass the password.

- The second round banned `--` so used `admin';` to bypass the password and move forward with the next round

- The third challenge did not ban anything that i was already using so used the same thing `admin';` to move forward to the next round.

-This part was tricky the filter blocked the word `admin`

- The part wanted me to use String concatenation which i reffrenced from a sql cheatsheet i found online employed that to trick it into giving me admin without using admin used `adm'||'in';` which added the strings and then bypasses the password.

- The fifth round did not ban anything that i was already using so used the same thing again to complete the challenge
  `adm'||'in';` 
- The flag was present in the filter page.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Basics of Sql injection 
- `--` makes the sql ignore everything written after which helps in bypassing the password for example in this challenge `--` made 
```
WHERE username='[YOUR INPUT]' AND password='...'
```
to 
```
WHERE username='admin'--'
```
- Simmilarly `;` maks an end to reading for sql, it wont read anything after this which would help in bypassing the password
- String concatenation:
You can concatenate together multiple strings to make a single string.
## Notes:

- The String Concatenation part was tricky took me a lot of time to figure that out.
