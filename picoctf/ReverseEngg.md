# 1. GDB baby step 1

> Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag 
format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your 
flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Disassemble this.

## Solution:

- I first checked for the type of file `debugger0_a` was using the command `file` 
```
  vishalsharan@Vishals-MacBook-Air Downloads % file debugger0_a
debugger0_a: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=15a10290db2cd2ec0c123cf80b88ed7d7f5cf9ff, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
- After confirming it was an ELF 64-bit executable, I launched an Ubuntu x86-64 Docker container and installed neccesary dependencies to use `file` and `string`. I reffered to Gemini for the syntax.

- I made the file executable using `chmod +x` but that was no help so as per the hint I installed `gdb` the syntax for which i got from a tutorial video I got on youtube about `gdb` the link to which I have provided in the refferences

```
root@cc71042c3bbd:/shared# apt-get install gdb
```
- The tutorial crafted my thought process i first used `info funtion` to analyse all the functions inside the file, there I found `main` function as instructed in the challenge.

- Then used the command `disassemble main` to disassemble the main function

```
(gdb) disassemble main 
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001129 <+0>:	endbr64
   0x000000000000112d <+4>:	push   %rbp
   0x000000000000112e <+5>:	mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000000001131 <+8>:	mov    %edi,-0x4(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001134 <+11>:	mov    %rsi,-0x10(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:	mov    $0x86342,%eax
   0x000000000000113d <+20>:	pop    %rbp
   0x000000000000113e <+21>:	ret
End of assembler dump.

```
- Over there I found the eax required to solve the challenge the number was in hexadecimal so coverted it to decimal to decimal which gave the number `549698` Employed the number in the flag format as instructed to solve the challenge.

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{549698}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Basics of GDB workflow - Employing basic functions like `info function` and `disassemble` to understand assembly instructions
- GDB is a debugger which lets me stop the program at specific points and lets us examine what is happening at that exact moment.
- `disassemble` lets you read what exactly the program is telling the CPU to do i.e translating the low-level code to assembly which can be interepreted by us
- I dont really understand the output but the challenge wanted me to find `eax` which i found just lying there.
- Coverting Hex to decimal .

## Notes:

- rosetta error- the file was in `x86-64` and i use a mac so naturally i ran an ARM version of ubuntu on my terminal which gave me this error i fixed it by using the `x86-64` version of Ubuntu

# 2. ARMssembly 1

> For what argument does this program print `win` with variables 81, 0 and 3? File: chall_1.S Flag format: picoCTF{XXXXXXXX} -> (hex, lowercase, no 0x, and 32 bits. ex. 5614267 would be picoCTF{0055aabb})

## Solution:

- Include as many steps as you can with your thought process
- You **must** include images such as screenshots wherever relevant.

```
put codes & terminal outputs here using triple backticks

you may also use ```python for python codes for example
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Include the new topics you've come across and explain them in brief
- 

## Notes:

- Include any alternate tangents you went on while solving the challenge, including mistakes & other solutions you found.
- 

## Resources:

- Include the resources you've referred to with links. [example hyperlink](https://google.com)
