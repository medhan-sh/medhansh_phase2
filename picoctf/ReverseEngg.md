> Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag 
format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your 
flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Disassemble this.

## Solution:

- I first checked for the type of file `debugger0_a` was using the command `file` 
```
  vishalsharan@Vishals-MacBook-Air Downloads % file debugger0_a
debugger0_a: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=15a10290db2cd2ec0c123cf80b88ed7d7f5cf9ff, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
- After analysing that this is an `ELF` file of `x86-64 architecture i started a docker container running ubuntu x86-64 and insstalled the neccesary dependencies

- I ran

```
put codes & terminal outputs here using triple backticks

you may also use ```python for python codes for example
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{549698}
